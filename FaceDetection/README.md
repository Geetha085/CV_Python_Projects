# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using a webcam and OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier.

## 📸 Overview

The application captures live video from your webcam, detects faces in each frame using the Haar Cascade method, and draws bounding rectangles around detected faces.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time video capture from webcam
- Face detection using Haar cascades
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes
- Exit the application by pressing the **'a'** key

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV (cv2)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
